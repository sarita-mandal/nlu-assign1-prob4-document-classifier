# Sports or Politics Document Classifier
- This project involves the development and evaluation of an automated text classifier designed to distinguish between "Sports" and "Politics" documents.

- Three distinct feature representation methods are explored: Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and TF-IDF with N-grams. Three machine learning algorithms are compared: Multinomial Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree.

- The methodology consists of a comprehensive pipeline involving data collection, exploratory dataset analysis, model training, and quantitative comparison.

- The model evaluation metrics used are accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.
